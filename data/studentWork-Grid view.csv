It's a demonstration of what is lost in natural processes when one breaks down all phenomena into discrete, measurable parts in order to understand its whole. The piece is comprised of a fish tank with a shallow whirlpool that moves leaves in a circular motion. The shadows from those leaves are read by photo-resistors attached to the bottom of the tank, which is then transferred into a linear circuit via a conglomeration of wires and transistors. The final output is a “low res” image of the tank, with “approximations” of where the leaves are. The dynamic fluid flow makes the output seem random. The wires and circuitry are fully exposed, showing the whole system in its entirety.

Filial Piety(孝), as one of the fundamental ethics of achieving benevolence (仁), has been inherited as a traditional ethic that enhances the importance of family in Taiwan and other East Asian cultures. It is a key virtue of respect for one's parents, elders, and ancestors.

Our world is located in Taiwan, and the time is set to 2030. We selected five stories from The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars(二十四孝), a classic text of Confucian filial piety written during the Yuan dynasty (1260–1368). We alter and re-contextualize them with the further advance of technology with the essence of  Filial Piety, and named it as Filial Piety Futurism. Besides a variety of news, we also embed the philosophy and concept into an advertisement, weather forecast, and even public commendation.

The enhanced community quarantine in Luzon has left informal ""no work, no pay"" workers (street vendors, public transportation drivers, etc.) and their families extremely vulnerable. This lockdown, which has been extended to last until April 31, 2020, has also made it nearly impossible for daily wage earners to stay afloat without any outside support.

A vast majority of these contractual workers and daily wage earners come from impoverished neighborhoods whose residents earn far below the required legal required daily minimum wage of PHP 537— the equivalent of only USD $10. Thus even the slightest disruption to their livelihoods has grave consequences.

For every USD $10 raised, Kapit will send a relief package to a low-income household affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in the Philippines.

The ball can bounce off your head as you hit it- heading the ball experience created using ml5,"The concept stems from a sculpture created by artist Lucy Humphrey at the Sculpture by the sea exhibition at Bondi. The sculpture is called Horizon. I remember this sculpture from a research I was doing for the ideation class last month. This is a sculpture model of a water filled ball she was presented during her visit in Venice.
 I have created a replica of the model which creates a pseudo reflective effect using the video feedback. The reflective ellipsoid replaces the face of the user and moves with the motion. The background is the live video feedback of the user and the ball inverts the feedback and moves according to the user’s motion. As with the library, it also detects multiple users and creates multiple reflective models. I have used ML5 Posenet and WebGL to mimic the effects of the model. This effect is also mimicked by a lot of photographers to incorporate an inverted image using the water filled ball.
Fork1:
While the actual sculpture is created using a water filled sphere to reflect the surroundings, I have mimicked the effect by rendering the camera as texture on a 3D model which adjusts itself according to the face dimensions and co-ordinates.


Fork 2:
I have also created a bouncing sphere which bounces off the head as a fork for the same. I did not want to incorporate it as it contrasts with the concept. The bouncing ball responds to gravity and the position of the head.  This is a result of a teeny bit of curiosity which stemmed while exploring animation of objects independent but at the same time dependent of the user’s animation.

By merging my two passions I strongly believe that it is possible to develop products while being true to an identity that represents avant-garde structured looks using sustainable process and socially responsible manufacturing to let the most diverse group of people express themselves through exclusive ways that will cause an impact on others just as the release of a new ground-breaking research discovery.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PHoiWq0hEqfe68SxagfWAim9QXxEER6h,http://www.gutoledow.com,"Sewing Machine, Sticky Notes, Failed 3D prints, 3D printer, Hot Glue Gun, Irridescent Fabric, Tulle, Autodesk Maya, Photoshop, Illustrator, Laser Cutter, Gold Leaves, Vinyl.",@gutoledow,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TfbIqEcxqTkyhUEDbu6d09wVo6nZYtoA, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gUlLiCUHELchfbgyV5Cjb442QvOIGE0O, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VXR5yrwbZqKjD1Wp6uVrRBOqwl_m12HY, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rFa2D7bkxDRxE4PyZbOe62xnEnH7RYb4, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DckBz_PtCLIyeyanI7n7frAhA9g_DCqZ, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dPXmW1wSlW0U-lCQxdSd43gTXQQdOkbh, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jZ7_URemRTP41s8ll9Ws0O7eXEG3t8E4, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QB1GVK_WutzaDK1nRPjEeaSFXm1A8H3h, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vZeU_S5NEQpthBxTHtKlAV-tWXK0ODLl, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vRaAOyUD8x-8OcOX78PAepgOZgNz-Rjd",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IonqJ8r_TghZCuv5FOJpGgDWk1WWjf31,https://vimeo.com/414920902,http://www.gutoledow.com,,http://www.gutoledow.com,,Experiments & Speculative Tech,Wearables

This project focuses on the experiences of wheelchair users and aims to bring awareness to the microaggressions and lack of accessibility of the urban living experience.

To help bring awareness an interactive narrative was developed to help educate the next generation of students to think about universal design and accessibility. With this game, I hope to educate people on the microaggressions of the urban experience for Millenials and Gen Z that live in urban areas.

This graduate level course provided an opportunity for students to explore and develop prototypes as solutions to some of the accessibility challenges in museums. Our team was tasked with building solutions for Over-and-Under Stimulating Environments and learned that museums want to implement accessibility resources but often are unable to do so due to various constraints (budget, resources, bandwidth, etc). Our hope is that the Sensory Resource Guide is standardized, easy to use for museums staff, but more importantly, will help individuals with sensory processing challenges navigate different environmental settings. The suggested resources will provide visitors with the knowledge of what to expect when planning visits to museums and historic sites to optimize their experiences. Through our guide, we aim to increase museum engagement and interaction for visitors with different sensory needs. This class is a collaboration between the NYU Ability Project and the Intrepid Air, Sea and Space museum and this is funded through an IMLS grant (https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2019/october/nyu-ability-project-and-intrepid-.html).",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fvzS4oW37dhyUkVLO40tMftz7GFC7Gjk,https://wp.nyu.edu/sensory_resources_guide_for_museums/,Wordpress,,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mz84cGkUYod_6Eb7gTQKRRitAIcQ526I,,,https://wp.nyu.edu/sensory_resources_guide_for_museums/,,,,Problem-Solving,Web

Connect-U is more of an information and peer help platform that enables prospective graduate students to connect with current graduate students/ alumni and help with their choice of major.

This project was built to close the gap of misinformation within students while also providing honest feedback and mentor ship. The hope is that by giving students a platform to honestly give their opinions and experiences, students would get the help they need directly from other students who were at some point in the same position as them.

After understanding the pressure points of the user and the journey, I thought the platform would need the following features.

Mentor Chat
Chat with alumni/ current students. This feature is the one that helps overcome the most important pressure point of the user- their confusion. Talking to someone who can become a mentor will not only facilitate prospective students to gain more knowledge about programs and universities but also have some to talk to about all their doubts and questions.

Resources
One more insight I gained from interviewing prospective students was the lack of resources available at one click. One has to really search deep and extensively on Google about great rankings and forums that help with the application process and help connect with students who are in the same process.

How to Guide
The How To Guide will act like a pre-checklist for all the students to start their application for Graduate School. I compiled a 10 easy step guide to apply to graduate school by looking at my graduate application notes from 2017 and major school requirements.
